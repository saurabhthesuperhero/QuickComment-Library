## Installation

### Step 1: Clone or Download

Clone this repository into your project directory, or download the ZIP and extract it.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuickComment.git

### Step 2: Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database for QuickComment.
2. Import the `comments.sql` file provided in the QuickComment folder into your database to create the necessary table structure.

### Step 3: Configure Database Connection

Open `commentHandler.php` and update the database connection settings with your own details:

```php
$host = 'your_database_host';
$dbname = 'your_database_name';
$username = 'your_database_username';
$password = 'your_database_password';
```

### Step 4: Include QuickComment in Your Site

Add the following lines to the HTML of the page where you want the comment system to appear:

```html
<script src="path/to/QuickComment/commentSystem.js"></script>
<div id="comment-system"></div>
```

Make sure to replace `path/to/QuickComment/` with the actual path to the QuickComment folder in your project.

## Usage

Once installed, QuickComment is ready to use. Visitors to your site can start adding comments immediately, and existing comments will be displayed in the designated area.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the comment section by modifying the CSS in `commentSystemUI.html` or by overriding these styles in your site's CSS files.
